#Not-So-Instagram
A photo sharing web app. I paired with [@hamchapman](htt://www.twitter.com/hamchapman).
 * Built using Ruby on Rails.
 * Photo uploading with Paperclip
 * User Login with Devise
 * Users can buy photos using Stripe
 * Realtime photo updates using websocket
 * Also uses Google maps for photo geo-location and Mailgun for email confirmation of photo purchases.
